Data Structures Lab

Pointers and Ordered Lists
Objective:
The objective of this Lab is to manipulate an ordered list and explore possible efficiency
options in creating the list.
Task 1: Create an ordered list class.
1. Create a new project. You can name this whatever you like.
2. Design and implement an ordered list class using an array of pointers as described in
class. This class should be a template. The template is expected to have overloaded the
>, < and == operators.
a. The class should have an array that holds 20 items.
b. The AddItem method should start at the front of the array when searching for a
place to insert a new item.
c. The RemoveItem method should ensure that the items in the array are still in
order and there are no empty spots between items.
d. The class should include IsEmpty, IsFull and MakeEmpty methods.
3. Any error conditions encountered such as the item to be removed doesnâ€™t exist or the
list is full when trying to add an item should throw a custom error class or be displayed
on the console.
Complete this before moving on to task 2.
Task 2: Create a derived class from the class created in Task 1. This version of the class is to
investigate the theory that by starting from the end, fewer items will need to be moved on
every insert
1. This version should have the AddItem method start from the end of the array when
searching for a place to insert a new item.
Complete this before moving on to task 3.
Task 3: Create another derived class from the class created in Task 1. This version of the class
is to investigate leaving blank spots in the array can reduce the number of moves when
inserting.
1. Modify the AddItem method to insert an item halfway between any two items in the
array where it belongs. It should only move items in the array if the inserting item sits
between two items that are in contiguous locations.
2. Modify the RemoveItem method so that it will not move any items in the array.
3. Include in your lab submission a paragraph for each of the 3 versions of the class a
description of what is trying to be achieved, what the strengths and weaknesses are and
how you think it will perform.
Complete this before moving on to task 4.
Task 4: Create a test program.
1. Create a test program to test the 3 classes performance.
a. This should instantiate each of the three classes.
b. This should insert 30 randomly generated items into the array (using integers as
the list data type might be the easiest way to do this).
c. This should remove 25 items from the array.
d. Individual inserts and removed from steps from b and c should be randomly
selected rather than done sequentially.
e. Every comparison and move operation in the AddItem and RemoveItem
methods should be counted (except checks to see if an array location holds a
nullptr). The total at the end of the run should be displayed to measure
efficiency of the class.
f. Every insert/remove operation should be identically performed against all 3 of
the class instances.
2. Run the program 100 times against the 3 versions of the class. Describe your results and
how they compare with your expected results from the end of Task 3
3. Increase the size of the array to hold 50 items. And rerun the program 100 times.
Describe your results and how they compare with the previous step.
4. Decrease the size of the array to hold 10 items and rerun the program 100 times.
Describe your results and how they compare with the previous step.
5. Include in the lab report a screen shot(s) of the output of a test.
